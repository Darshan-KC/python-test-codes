# Write a test file for Employee with two test functions, test_give_default 
# _raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Write your tests once without using a 
# fixture, and make sure they both pass. Then write a fixture so you donâ€™t have to 
# create a new employee instance in each test function. Run the tests again, and 
# make sure both tests still pass.
